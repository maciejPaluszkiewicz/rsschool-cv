### About me:
I am flexible and easily adaptable, full of ideas and ready to improvise if
needed. 
As a perfectionist I love to be well prepared and plan everything
before starting working on a project, to eliminate as many surprises as
possible. 
My main strengths are creativity and aesthetic skills, I have
lots of hobbies and many of them are connected to artistic talent and
handicrafts. 
I like to work with people, as a supportive and friendly team mate,
also as a fast-growing mentee. 
Team leading experience has improved my problem and conflict solving skills. 
I never hesitate to ask questions to make everything clear.
